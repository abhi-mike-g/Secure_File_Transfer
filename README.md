# 🔒 Secure File Transfer System using RSA & ECC

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **secure file transfer system** leveraging modern cryptography techniques:

* **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA-2048 and ECC (secp256r1) for **key exchange**.
* **Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256 for encrypting the actual file content.
* Designed for **performance evaluation** and **security analysis** of different key exchange mechanisms.

The system is modular, allowing easy testing of RSA and ECC workflows on different file sizes.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

1. **AES-256 Symmetric Encryption**

   * Encrypts actual file data efficiently.
   * Keys are 32 bytes (256 bits).
   * Uses CBC mode with random IV.

2. **RSA-2048 Asymmetric Encryption**

   * Encrypts AES keys for secure transfer.
   * Public/private keys are 2048 bits (\~256 bytes).
   * Uses OAEP padding with SHA-256.

3. **ECC (secp256r1) + ECDH**

   * Efficient key exchange to derive shared AES key.
   * Smaller key size (256 bits) with comparable security.
   * Uses HKDF to derive a 32-byte AES key from ECDH shared secret.

## 🔐 File Encryption Flow

1. **Key Generation**

   * Generate AES-256 key for file encryption.
   * Generate RSA-2048 or ECC key pairs for key exchange.

2. **Key Exchange**

   * **RSA**: Encrypt AES key with recipient's public key.
   * **ECC**: Use ECDH to derive a shared AES key.

3. **File Encryption / Decryption**

   * AES encrypt the file in 1 MB chunks.
   * IV stored at the beginning of the encrypted file.
   * AES decrypt using same key at the receiver side.

---

## 🔧 Usage

1. Prepare sample files in `test_files/`.
2. Run `main.py` to benchmark both RSA and ECC:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

* Generate RSA/ECC keys
* Encrypt/decrypt AES keys
* Encrypt/decrypt files
* Measure and print performance timings
